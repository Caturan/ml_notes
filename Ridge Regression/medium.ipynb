    "- Ridge regression is a varioation of linear regression, specifically designed to address multicollinerarity in the dataset.\n",
    "- In linear regression, the goal is to find the best-fitting hyperplane that minimizes the sum of squared differences between the observed and predicted values. However, when there are highly correlated variables, linear regression may become unstable and provide unreliable estimates. "

    "- Ridge regression introduces a regularization term that penalizes large coefficients, helping to stabilize the model and prevent overfitting.\n",
    "- The regularization term, also known as the L2 penalty, adds a constraint to the optimization process, influencing the model to choose smaller coefficinets for the predictors. \n",
    "- By striking a balance between fitting the data well and keeping the coefficients in check, ridge regression proves valuable in improving the robustness and performance of linear regression models, espcially in situations with multicollinearity."

    "#### How Ridge Regression Balance and Variance \n",
    "- 1. High Variance (Overfitting): \n",
    "    - When a model has too many parameters or the regularization is too weak (λ is small), it can fit the noise in the training data. \n",
    "    - Ridge regression reduces variance by shrinking the model coefficients toward zero, making the model simpler and less sensitive to noise. \n",
    "- 2. High Bias (Underfitting):\n",
    "    - When λ is too large, the penalty term dominates, and the model coefficients are overly shrunk. \n",
    "    - This results in high bias as the model fails to capture the true underlying patterns in the data. \n",
    "3. Tradedoff Mechanism: \n",
    "    - λ controls the tradeoff between bias and variance:\n",
    "        - Small λ: Lower bias, higher variance. \n",
    "        - Large λ: Higher bias, lower variance. \n",
    "    - The optimal λ balances the two to minimize the total error (sum of bias squared, variance and irreducible error)."
