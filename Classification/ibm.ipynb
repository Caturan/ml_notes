    "### Step1: Learning \n",
    "- Classification has traditionally been a type of supervised machine learning, which means it uses labeled data to train models. \n",
    "- In classification training, the model's job is to understand the relationships between features and class label, then apply those criteria to future datasets. \n",
    "- In mathematical terms, the model consider each data point as a tuple. Atuple is an ordered numerical sequence that is represented as x={x1,x2,x3...xn}.\n",
    "-  Each value in the tuple is a feature of the data point. \n",
    "- The purpose of training is to minimize errors during predictive modeling. \n",
    "    - Gradient descent algorithms train models by minimizing the gap between predicted and acutal results. \n",
    "    - Model can later be fine-tuned with more training to perform more specific tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unsupervised learning methods enable models to discover pattern in unlabeled data by themselves. \n",
    "- Semisupervised learning combines labeled and unlabeled data to train models for classificcation and regression purposes.  \n",
